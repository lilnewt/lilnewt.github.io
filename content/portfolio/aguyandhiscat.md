I love to make cards for friends and family, rather than buying them from a store. This painting was for the front a card for my brother on his birthday. It features him, his guitar, and his cat for a personalized feel you can't get 
with a store bought card.   

The inspiration behind the image style came from vector portraits that are done digitally and simplify figures into more basic shapes and blocks of color.
 I tried to capture that style but while handpainting it by omitting fine details and using a limited, more generalized, tonal range for each color.
