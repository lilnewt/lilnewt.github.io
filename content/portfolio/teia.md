Teia was painted for one of my first customers on Etsy. The color scheme going in was intended to contain lots of blues in the back, and white for the fur. As I progressed I started to incorporate more colors, including light pink, purple and mint tones
to add depth and pops of color to her fur.

This more muted, pastel color pallete was a welcomed change of pace from my usual bright colored pet portraits. The color scheme ended up being very subdued and almost atherial, making for a very serene memorial painting of Teia.
