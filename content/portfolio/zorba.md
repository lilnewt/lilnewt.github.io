![Example image](/img/portfolio/zorba.jpg)

Zorba was painted using primarily a pallette knife to lay down general shapes and blocks of color. I went in with a brush for the finer details in the face and fur near the end. While creating the work, the goal 
I was setting out to achieve through the colors and the mark making was to capture the expressive and vibrant personality of my partner's dog. 

This is the painting that really started my journey as a freelance artist and Esty seller. I fell in love with the process of making colorful pet portraits like this one. The joy I got from making it coupled with positive feedback I got from this painting, encouraged me to finally open an
Etsy shop to expand my reach and create for more people.
