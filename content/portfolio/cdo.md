The first logo I ever made; made for the Cyber Defense Organiztion at SUNY Albany. It was a learning experience creating this logo and a very valuable one. Designing this logo gave me experience working with a client as well as helped
me build foundational knowledge of Adobe Photoshop. The idea behind this logo was to take the great dane mascot of the unuiversity and modify it to make it have more of a modern, cyber asthetic. I thoroughly enojyed making it and am 
incredibly satisfied with the outcome.   

It's incredibly fulfilling to see my logo being used by the club. Seeing the whole team decked out in jackets and shirts with my design on them... walking through the business and seeing the logo on the TV or promotional flyers...
it's a surreal feeling I'm not sure I'll ever get used to.
