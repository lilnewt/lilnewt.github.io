![Example image](/img/portfolio/cdo.png)

This was the first logo I ever made. I created it for the Cyber Defense Organization at my University. I learnt a lot about Adobe 
Illustrator as well as what it's like working with a client through the process of making it. This logo is what really sparked my interest in graphic
design and pursuing it more. Seeing the logo posted around the school and on jackets and shirts is a very surreal and rewarding experience!
