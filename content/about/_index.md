+++
I'm currently a junior at the University at Albany studying User Experience, Fine Art, and Communications. Outside of art and school I love to do yoga and go hiking. I've lived in the Capital Region of NY my whole life and one of my favorite things about living here is 
being surrounded by amazing places to hike like the Adirondacks and the Catskills.

I have many passions, but my biggest passion in life has always been art. From elementary school all the way to college it has been my favorite class. My love of art is what drew me to UX and Web Design. I love the way 
that it allows me to be creative and apply skills I've learned over the years as an artist in a new way.

I'm currently seeking a challenging and engaging internship in User Experience Design where I can enhance my design skills and exercise creativity.
